Hi everyone!

This project is going to show you how to create a web api using VSCode. Also I used Dapper ORM for this project.

WARNING! --> I did use any exception in QuestionRep and GetQuestion Function. Please use try-catch for these functions. 

write the console --> "dotnet add package Dapper "  for using dapper orm.
